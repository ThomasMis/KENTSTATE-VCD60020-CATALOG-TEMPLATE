# Course Catalog Templates
- Graduate Studio
- Spring 2024


## Problem

Undergraduate VCD majors do not have an authoritative resource for previewing the design outcomes of the courses in the VCD curriculum. The existing course catalog only contains textural descriptions. There are no visual examples that illustrate what students will produce. 

## Solution

The graduate students in the Spring 2024 Graduate Studio designed a companion catalog for the VCD program. The companion catalog augments the official university catalog with examples of student work for each studio course. 
This repository contains webpage templates for the companion catalog. There are two types of templates: studio courses and lecture courses. Each studio course will have its own dedicated webpage. However, the lecture courses will be aggregated within a single webpage. This was due to the fact that visual design is generally not produced as part of a lecture course. 

## Organization

- The **Studio Template** directory contains the HTML and CSS file templates for studio courses. The instructions for customizing the studio template are contained within the HTML file. Only the HTML file requires customization. 
- The **Typography II** directory contains a populated example of the studio template for the course Typography II. 
- The **Lecture Template** directory contains the HTML and CSS file templates for the lecture courses. New courses can be added directly into the HTML file. 

## Customization

- The instructions for customizing the studio template are contained with the HTML file. There are 8 individual steps that are required to populate the template for a new course. Details on each step are in the HTML comments.
- The Lecture template is not intended to be reused and can be hosted as-is. Adding new courses to the template will involve copying, pasting, and customizing everything between the `<div class=”masonry”>` element.
